A beginner-friendly iOS app project for every-other-day trading.

## What is this?

This app helps you practice “every-other-day” passive trading strategies by fetching NYSE data and flagging stocks that open substantially higher than their previous close.

## Instructions

1. **You’ll need a Mac with Xcode** to run or edit this project.
2. All starter code is in Swift and SwiftUI (Apple’s beginner-friendly language and UI system).
3. Inside `Services/StockAPI.swift`, you’ll plug in your stock data provider’s details later (instructions will be provided when you’re ready).
4. Don’t hesitate to ask questions—this starter is for absolute beginners!

## Next Steps

- Open this project folder in Xcode.
- Build and run on the iOS simulator or your device.
- Next, you can get a free API key from Alpha Vantage or another data source (instructions will follow).
